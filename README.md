Project work

This project is dedicated to the creation of the game Evolution, which represents a model of wildlife: the life of herbivores and predators (they are called pacmans in the code).

The main loop of the program is done in the file "main_evolution".The "evolution_classes" file contains all the objects used in the game. The "evolution_variables" file contains all libraries and unchangeable variables. The file "evolution_functions" contains all functions that are not class methods.
